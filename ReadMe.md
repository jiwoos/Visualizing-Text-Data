I used beautifulSoup and NLTK to parse the data from html file. To run, you should have both downloaded in your computer.

Python files are used to parse data from englishfairytales.html.
Parsed data are stored in data/ folder.

outputs.csv stores title, parsed strings, and original text of raw html.
sentiment_score.json stores sentiment analysis data made with nltk.
tale0 - 43.csv files store word by word arrays of each story.

D3.js, Python
